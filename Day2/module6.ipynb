High blood pressure and high cholesterol are  dangerous but have no warning signs. You should  schedule regular tests with your health care  professional to make sure your levels are OK. Also,  ask about the healthiest weight for you.   It’s important to know your numbers. You can record  your blood pressure, cholesterol and weight in the  table below to track your progress. Talk to your  health care professional about your numbers and  how they affect your overall risk. Then ask how often  to check your levels.

These guidelines reflect those established for the GLB program.  1. Eat a healthy diet   Eat at least 4.5 cups of fruits and vegetables a day.   Have at least two 3.5 ounce servings of fish a week (preferably oily fish).   Eat at least 3 servings of fiber-rich whole grains a day.   Limit sugar-sweetened beverages to not more than 450 calories (36 ounces) per week.   Eat less than 1500 mg of sodium a day.  2. Maintain a healthy body weight  3. Take charge of cholesterol   Goals for cholesterol - Think 50, 100, 150, 200   HDL – greater than 50 mg/dL(for women)   Greater than 40 mg/dL (for men)   LDL – less than 130 mg/dL (under 100 mg/dL is optimal)   Triglycerides – less than 150 mg/dL   Total cholesterol – less than 200 mg/dL  a. Testing is recommended starting at age 20.  b. Have your cholesterol profile done at least every five years to age 40, then every  year.  4. Manage blood pressure   Normal - less than 120/80 mm/Hg   Pre-hypertension - 120-139/80-89 mm/Hg   High blood pressure/hypertension - 140/90 mm/Hg or higher  5. Keep\n",

You also get cholesterol from animal foods you eat, such as meat, fish, poultry,  egg yolk, and dairy products.  •  HDL (high-density lipoprotein), “good cholesterol”, removes cholesterol from the body,  preventing it from building up in the arteries thus protecting against heart disease.  •  LDL (low-density lipoprotein), “bad cholesterol”, carries harmful cholesterol in the blood.  High levels can lead to blockages in the arteries, thus increasing the risk of heart disease.  •  Triglycerides are the most common type of fat in the body. High levels may increase the risk  of heart disease.  Facts about Blood Pressure  •  Blood pressure is the force exerted against the walls of the blood vessels as blood flows  through.  •  Blood pressure is measured with two readings:   Systolic (upper number) is the pressure against the walls of the arteries during a  contraction or heart beat.   Diastolic (lower number) is the pressure against the walls of the arteries during  the relaxation phase (the heart is at rest between beats).  •  High blood pressure is called the “silent killer” because t\n",
