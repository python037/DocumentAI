The good \nnews is that leading a healthy lifestyle can reduce your risk! \nWhat is heart disease? \n• \nHeart disease, also known as cardiovascular disease, is a group of diseases and conditions \nthat affect the heart (cardio) and blood vessels (vascular). \n• \nExamples: heart attack, high blood pressure, and stroke. \nRisk Factors: \nThe American Heart Association has identified the following risk factors: \n• \nIncreasing age \n• \nSex (male) \n• \nHeredity (including race) \n• \nSmoking \n• \nPhysical inactivity \n• \nHigh blood cholesterol \n• \nHigh blood pressure \n• \nDiabetes \n• \nObesity and Overweight \nMany risk factors can be controlled by being physically active and eating a healthy diet. \nA heart-healthy lifestyle is your best defense against heart disease. \nFacts about Cholesterol \n• \nCholesterol is a soft, waxy substance.
