People with \npre-diabetes and/or the metabolic syndrome are at higher risk for developing heart disease. The good \nnews is that leading a healthy lifestyle can reduce your risk! \nWhat is heart disease? \n• \nHeart disease, also known as cardiovascular disease, is a group of diseases and conditions \nthat affect the heart (cardio) and blood vessels (vascular). \n• \nExamples: heart attack, high blood pressure, and stroke. \nRisk Factors: \nThe American Heart Association has identified the following risk factors: \n• \nIncreasing age \n• \nSex (male) \n• \nHeredity (including race) \n• \nSmoking \n• \nPhysical inactivity \n• \nHigh blood cholesterol \n• \nHigh blood pressure \n• \nDiabetes \n• \nObesity and Overweight \nMany risk factors can be controlled by being physically active and eating a healthy diet. \nA heart-healthy lifestyle is your best defense against heart disease. \nFacts about Cholesterol \n• \nCholesterol is a soft, waxy substance.

You also get cholesterol from animal foods you eat, such as meat, fish, poultry, \negg yolk, and dairy products. \n• \nHDL (high-density lipoprotein), “good cholesterol”, removes cholesterol from the body, \npreventing it from building up in the arteries thus protecting against heart disease. \n• \nLDL (low-density lipoprotein), “bad cholesterol”, carries harmful cholesterol in the blood. \nHigh levels can lead to blockages in the arteries, thus increasing the risk of heart disease. \n• \nTriglycerides are the most common type of fat in the body. High levels may increase the risk \nof heart disease. \nFacts about Blood Pressure \n• \nBlood pressure is the force exerted against the walls of the blood vessels as blood flows \nthrough. \n• \nBlood pressure is measured with two readings: \n Systolic (upper number) is the pressure against the walls of the arteries during a \ncontraction or heart beat. \n Diastolic (lower number) is the pressure against the walls of the arteries during \nthe relaxation phase (the heart is at rest between beats). \n• \nHigh blood pressure is called the “silent killer” because t", "metadata": {"doc_id": "heart-health", "source_path": "..\\data\\pdfs\\heart-health.pdf", "page": 1, "char_start": 1000, "char_end": 2200, "section_title": null, "section_path": [], "scanned": false}}

Eat a healthy diet \n Eat at least 4.5 cups of fruits and vegetables a day. \n Have at least two 3.5 ounce servings of fish a week (preferably oily fish). \n Eat at least 3 servings of fiber-rich whole grains a day. \n Limit sugar-sweetened beverages to not more than 450 calories (36 ounces) per week. \n Eat less than 1500 mg of sodium a day. \n2. Maintain a healthy body weight \n3. Take charge of cholesterol \n Goals for cholesterol - Think 50, 100, 150, 200 \n HDL – greater than 50 mg/dL(for women) \n Greater than 40 mg/dL (for men) \n LDL – less than 130 mg/dL (under 100 mg/dL is optimal) \n Triglycerides – less than 150 mg/dL \n Total cholesterol – less than 200 mg/dL \na. Testing is recommended starting at age 20. \nb. Have your cholesterol profile done at least every five years to age 40, then every \nyear. \n4. Manage blood pressure \n Normal - less than 120/80 mm/Hg \n Pre-hypertension - 120-139/80-89 mm/Hg \n High blood pressure/hypertension - 140/90 mm/Hg or higher \n5.
