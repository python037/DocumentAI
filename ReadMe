Day 1 and Day 2 have 6 notebooks to understand how PDF + Image upload, chunking and vector store work along with end to end RAG flow with Memory managed Chatbot

DAY 3 contains:

RAG Chat Assistant
This is a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that allows you to upload documents and images, and then chat with them to get source-backed answers.

The application has two main components:

Flask Backend: Handles file processing, OCR, text chunking, vector indexing, and the RAG chain.

Gradio Frontend: Provides a user-friendly web interface for uploading files and chatting.

Features
File Upload: Supports PDFs, text files, and images (PNG, JPG, TIFF).

Automatic OCR: Extracts text from images and scanned PDFs.

Vector Indexing: Creates a searchable knowledge base from your documents using FAISS.

Chat Interface: Ask questions and get answers generated from the content of your files.

Source Citations: Every answer includes citations pointing to the original source document and page number.

Setup and Running
You will need two separate terminal windows to run the backend and frontend.

1. Run the Backend Server
First, set up and start the Flask backend.

# Navigate to your project directory

# (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install backend requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the backend server
python app.py

The backend will be running at http://localhost:8000.

2. Run the Frontend UI
In a new terminal, start the Gradio frontend.

# Navigate to your project directory (if not already there)

# Activate the virtual environment if you created one
source .venv/bin/activate # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Run the Gradio app
python gradio_app.py

Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided (usually http://127.0.0.1:7860).

How to Use
Check Backend Status: On the Gradio UI, click the "Check Backend Status" button to ensure the frontend is connected to the backend.

Upload Files: Go to the "Upload Files" tab, drag and drop your documents or images, and click the appropriate "Index" button.

Chat: Go to the "Chat" tab, ask a question about your documents, and press Enter or click "Send". The answer and its sources will appear.
